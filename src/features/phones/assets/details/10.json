      "title": "Compared to a Dying S9, it's Great!",
      "comment": "It's safe to say that my opinion of the S22 is influenced by just how bad my S9 had become.\n I was hesitant to purchase based on reviews mentioning short battery life, but I just didn't want a bigger phone. And compared to my S9 that was dying after 3 hours of use, the S22 is great. Most days I'm able to only charge once every 24 hours. I'm not a gamer or much of a video watcher and I'm sure that helps. It supports my social media habit just fine, as well as emails and googling around.\n And yes, the fingerprint scanner is a bit annoying. With it's constant \"not recognized\". I have found that it works better with a more patient purposeful press. It does not like a quick \"it's me let me in\" finger drive by.\n Being able to keep a reasonable sized phone, the cost, and coming from a phone in it's deathbed, I'm happy overall and glad I stopped deliberating and finally bought it.",
