      "comment": "Design: The usual Sony Xperia design is nothing new.\n Display: Beautiful 4k display and excellent color reproduction with 120hz but annoyingly it's only FHD if you're not watching videos or viewing photos.\n Battery: The largest battery ever on Xperia device and yes it does last you through the day.\n Camera: Probably the best camera I've used on a phone but the zoom camera it's not S22 ultra.\n Audio: Powerful front facing stereo speakers and there's a headphone jack.\n Software: Stock android 12 with few Sony apps and tweaks.\n Overheating issues: Used to overheat like crazy when shooting videos and regular photos, Sony released an update to fix the overheating about 50% but still overheats nonetheless but not that much now after the update.\n The Question is: should you buy it?\n The answer is: Yes if you want what is mentioned above, And No if you want a powerful zoom camera and can't tolerate with overheating issues.",

I have not added the fingerpirnt or facial recognition features yet. Otherwise it seems to be working well.",
