      "comment": "The A52s is an amazing value. The processor and RAM upgrade over the base A52 is significant. It's comparable, in some aspects superior, to the new A53 that just released, but for much less money. BTW - mine came with 8GB of RAM despite the listing stating 6GB.\n 5G: This phone only supports one of the frequency bands Tmobile uses for 5G, Band 41 at 2500 mHz. But, this is the good one, which Tmo calls \"ultra capacity 5G\". They also use Band 71, which this phone doesn't support, but the data speeds at that frequency are pretty comparable to 4G anyway.\n If your current phone isn't a 5G phone, you might need a new SIM card from Tmobile (I did), which they'll provide for free.\n Something that is possibly fooling other reviewers is that the phone doesn't show a \"5G\" icon next to the signal bars when it's connected to Band 41. It shows \"4G+\" instead. Why this is the case I don't know, but I confirmed with a radio signal anaylsis app (LTE Discovery) that it's indeed connected to 5G Band 41 when it displays the \"4G+\" icon.",
