        "content": "\"Always one step ahead\" - this is the tagline the Sony Xperia X is promoted with. It hints at the phone's ability to \"predict\" the direction of moving objects, thus ensuring accurate focus when taking photos. Speaking of photography, the phone's main camera is a key selling feature, with 23MP of resolution, super-wide viewing angles, and extremely fast autofocus. We're also promised great battery life with Sony's optimizations, added on top of Android 6.0. As for the handset itself, it is designed in typical, stylish Sony fashion, with straight lines and flat sides. For convenience's sake, you get a fingerprint scanner embedded in the power button (not available in the US), as well as front stereo speakers. However, water resistance - a feature found on many other Xperia models - has been skipped.\n\n"

I had a little difficulty with set up and needed to contact tracfone for an update to the texting feature that did not happen automatically. I have not added the fingerpirnt or facial recognition features yet. Otherwise it seems to be working well.",
