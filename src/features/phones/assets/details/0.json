        "content": "\"Always one step ahead\" - this is the tagline the Sony Xperia X is promoted with. It hints at the phone's ability to \"predict\" the direction of moving objects, thus ensuring accurate focus when taking photos. Speaking of photography, the phone's main camera is a key selling feature, with 23MP of resolution, super-wide viewing angles, and extremely fast autofocus. We're also promised great battery life with Sony's optimizations, added on top of Android 6.0. As for the handset itself, it is designed in typical, stylish Sony fashion, with straight lines and flat sides. For convenience's sake, you get a fingerprint scanner embedded in the power button (not available in the US), as well as front stereo speakers. However, water resistance - a feature found on many other Xperia models - has been skipped.\n\n"

Not about the OS which has been updated to N by the way. The performance is great and the battery lasts more than a day. I have about 40% left the next morning after a full day/eve of use. The size of the phone is perfect and feels very natural. I get people asking me what kind of phone is that? I am liking not being part of the Apple/Samsung crowds. People should start doing some research before just getting what everyone else has.",
