The battery health is still at 100%, it’s been refurbished but it’s literally brand new. No scratches or cracks. The only thing I can’t figure out is if this thing has facial recognition. The description says it does but I haven’t been able to find it in the settings. Excuse the dirty screen from my fingerprints.",
