      "comment": "It was time to get new cell phones - our old Samsung S9's (both me and my wife) are getting pretty old, and the batteries don't last very long anymore. We've had Samsung phones for a while now, so decided to stay with Samsung. I have to admit, getting the flip phone instead of the latest model rectangle was totally emotional - I just think the flip thing is cool! Samsung has done a great job making the hinge area nearly invisible when the phone is open, and from what I read, as long as you're somewhat careful, the flip/hinge will easily last a long time (longer than the battery, no doubt...} Speaking of battery, I have read the flip battery is a compromise and doesn't last as long as an equivalent rectangle phone. This may be true, but I find the battery in this phone lasts plenty long. As long as you're ok with charging it every night, you should be fine. A couple of other notes - Samsung makes it super easy to move all your apps, data, photos, whatever from your old phone to your new phone - their \"switch\" app worked seamlessly. Also, this was a purchase of an \"unlocked\" phone from Amazon. I carefully checked to make sure the 5G and 4G frequency bands covered by this phone were ones my carrier (T-Mobile) uses. Moving the SIM card from my old phone to the new one was all I needed to do to get the new phone to work on my network. The only thing that's missing as far as I can tell is we don't have T-Mobile ring tones anymore. If I cared, I could probably figure out how to download them... Anyway - a few weeks in, and love these phones!",
